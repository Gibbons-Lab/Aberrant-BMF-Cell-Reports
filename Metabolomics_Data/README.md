**Follow these steps to replicate the analysis:**
1. Open the .ipynb Jupyter Python notebook and observe/run the cells (if you have access to the Arivale dataset). The resulting .csv files should be used in the upcoming R analysis.
2. Open the .rmd file and observe/run the cells. The resulting image files are then used to produce the figures in the publication.
